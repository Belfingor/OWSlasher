This is a 3rd person Open World Slasher game made with Unreal Engine 5.6

There are no direct objectives in this game. However, you may still explore level I created, grind some coins and look for new weapons while fighting NPCs which patrol around the map. It is made purely for learning combat mechanics, AI behavior, open-world level design, UI and work with different assets.
